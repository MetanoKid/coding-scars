Hello again! I was waiting for you to continue with our Log Window!

In the last post we created the basic UI and functionality. However, that window does little by itself so we want to _convert it into a component_ we can plug into other projects. That way, we could focus on building a nice project with the help of a logging window!

Grabbed a drink? Then we're ready to start!

# The host program

We said we wanted to use the window from another project, right? Why don't we start building that first?

Let's add a new C# project into our solution. This time, we don't want a `WPF Application` but a `Console Application`. Let's give it a meaningful name... like `HostProgram`.

We'll have a new project with a new autogenerated _Program.cs_ file. Let's keep it and modify its `Main` to something familiar:

{% highlight c# %}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, set this project as the startup project: one way is to right-click on the project then select _Set as StartUp Project_. Then run the solution and you'll have the expected message in the console. Nothing new here.

What if we wanted to use the `LogEntry` class we created in our `LogWindowUI` project? Can we do this?

{% highlight c# %}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    LogEntry entry = new LogEntry
    {
        Timestamp = 0.0f,
        System = "TEST",
        Message = "Sample message!"
    };

    Console.WriteLine("[{0}][{1}] {2}",
        entry.Timestamp, entry.System, entry.Message);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately we can't... yet.

## Referencing projects

For our `HostProgram` to be able to use classes from the `LogWindowUI` project we need to connect them somehow. To do so, expand the `HostProgram` project and right-click `References`, select `Add Reference...`. Now enable the checkbox next to the `LogWindowUI` project and accept the dialog.

Our code still doesn't compile, but now we can add this line:

{% highlight c# %}
using LogWindowUI;
{% endhighlight %}

Because, if you remember, our `LogEntry` class was defined inside a namespace called `LogWindowUI`.

We can happily run our solution now and the formatted log message will show up in the console. We're getting there!

# Breaking it up

Okay, we've connected our projects but our `LogWindowUI` one is still a `Windows Application` and we want to make it a `Class Library`. We'll do that now, but first you should know everything will be broken until we complete some steps.

Start by opening the Properties page in the project (one way is double-clicking the `Properties` entry when you expand the project). Select `Class Library` from the _Output type_ control, then save.

You will now see several errors in the _Error List_ panel. The first one says:

_Library project file cannot specify ApplicationDefinition element._
{: .notice--primary}

## Removing App.xaml

Do you remember, from previous post, that the startup of the UI felt like _Magic_ because we apparently never said where it should start? Remember the two concepts we discussed: _Application_ and _Window_?

One of the files, `App.xaml`, defines the entry point and which _Window_ to display when we launch the program. Because we'll be using this project as a `Class Library`, the host program will be responsible of managing the life cycle itself. We'll just provide tools for it to work. So, delete `App.xaml` and the error will go away.

Except not! It looks like it has deleted `App.xaml.cs` as well and we don't have an _Application_ anymore!

## Creating App.cs

Let's add a new class called `App` in our `LogWindowUI` project with this code, pretty similar to what `App.xaml.cs` had:

{% highlight c# %}
namespace LogWindowUI
{
    class App : Application
    {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

With this, all errors will go away and we can run our console-based _hello log_. Impressive :)

But, how do we connect them now?

# Showing window from host program

So far we've gained access to the classes in the `LogWindowUI` project from the `HostProgram` one. However, we're left with a sad log message in the console and no WPF window.

To keep things clean, we should expose some class that lets us create the window, send it messages and close it when necessary instead of dealing with the internal classes from the outside. We only want to have one window at the same time, so... guess which design pattern we'll be using?

## Singleton pattern

You may have heard of the [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern){:target="_blank"} before. It allows us to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object. It's used when it doesn't make sense to have several instances of one class, commonly when you're defining a manager of some sorts or a wrapper to an underlying system which should have a single entry point.

Bob Nystrom ([@munificentbob](https://twitter.com/munificentbob){:target="_blank"}), in his [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com){:target="_blank"}, has [an awesome chapter](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html){:target="_blank"} about the pattern so go and read it if you want to know the good and bad parts about it.

A simple C# implementation of the pattern is this one:

{% highlight c# %}
public sealed class LoggerUI
{
    private static LoggerUI m_instance = null;
    public static LoggerUI Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if(m_instance == null)
            {
            	m_instance = new LoggerUI();
            }
            return m_instance;
        }
    }

    private LoggerUI()
    {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

However, this _lazy initialization_ (the instance isn't created until the first piece of code accesses it by using the `Instance` property) takes life cycle control from us (and isn't thread safe). We'd want to explicitly control when the instance is created and when it's destroyed. Let's make it so:

{% highlight c# %}
public sealed class LoggerUI
{
    private static LoggerUI m_instance = null;
    public static LoggerUI Instance
    {
        get
        {
            Debug.Assert(m_instance != null, "LoggerUI not initialized");
            return m_instance;
        }
    }

    private LoggerUI()
    {
    }

    public static void Initialize()
    {
        Debug.Assert(m_instance == null, "LoggerUI already initialized");
        m_instance = new LoggerUI();
    }

    public static void Destroy()
    {
    	Debug.Assert(m_instance != null, "LoggerUI already destroyed!");
        m_instance = null;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This way, we control the life cycle ourselves. It isn't thread safe either, but we'll be sure to `Initialize` and `Destroy` in a single-thread part of the program. Let's also add a new method to test it:

{% highlight c# %}
public void Add(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Calling from host

For now, our host program just has a `Main` function from which we'll call everything:

{% highlight c# %}
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // intialization step
    LoggerUI.Initialize();

    // [...] some other code in our program

    LoggerUI.Instance.Add("Hello, world!");

    // [...] some other code in our program

    // teardown step
    LoggerUI.Destroy();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And it works as expected, yay! Now, let's show the window again!

## STA, Application and Window

Remember the `App.xaml` file we had before we broke everything? If we stripped it a bit we'd have this:

{% highlight xml %}
<Application x:Class="LogWindowUI.App"
             StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
</Application>
{% endhighlight %}

Which is telling the runtime to use the `LogWindowUI.App` class as the _Application_ and then display the _Window_ defined at `MainWindow.xaml` (whose `x:Class` attribute points to `MainWindow.xaml.cs`).

So it looks like we need an _Application_ that displays a _Window_. Okay, what else?  
In the previous post we mentioned WPF uses the `Single Thread Apartment` model: any object created within a thread can only be modified from that thread (the _UI Thread_). Guess we need one of those too.

We've defined our `LoggerUI` singleton class as the entry point to our WPF library. We could have the _Application_ as a member of `LoggerUI` and tie its creation to the creation of the singleton itself. Something like this:

{% highlight c# %}
private App m_application = null;

private LoggerUI()
{
    Thread t = new Thread(() =>
    {
        m_application = new App();
        m_application.Run(new MainWindow());
    });
    t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
    t.Start();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, just what we said we'd do. But there's a catch.

When we run this code, it's not guaranteed the _Application_ and its _Window_ are running after we call `LoggerUI.Initialize()` (which ends up calling the constructor and thus this code). If we were to start logging stuff right after calling `Initialize` it could fail because `m_application` could be uninitialized. Ah, the joy of multithreading.

One way of solving this issue is to wait for the _Application_ to be ready. After all, it's part of the initialization process. We can use an `AutoResetEvent` to wait in our _main thread_ until the _Application_ and _Window_ are running. We could rewrite the constructor with this code:

{% highlight c# %}
private LoggerUI()
{
    AutoResetEvent windowCreatedEvent = new AutoResetEvent(false);
    Thread t = new Thread(() =>
    {
        m_application = new App();
        MainWindow window = new MainWindow();

        m_application.MainWindow = window;
        m_application.MainWindow.Show();

        // notify they are created before we block this thread
        windowCreatedEvent.Set();

        m_application.Run();
    });
    t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
    t.Start();

    // wait until the application and window are created
    windowCreatedEvent.WaitOne();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note how we've separated the _Window_ creation from the _Application_'s `Run` method. When you create a _Window_ it starts hidden, so we must call `Show` ourselves or let `Run` do it for us. Oh, and `Run` blocks until the _Window_ is closed, so we must signal the event before doing it. The _Application_ is already created by then so we can start manipulating it.

If we were to run the program now we'd see something like this:

![Unconnected console and WPF window]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}/assets/images/per-post/log-window-2/console-and-window-base.png){: .align-center}

All that's left is sending messages from the host program to our WPF library instead of mocking them!

## Connecting logs

As you can see in the previous picture, we had a way of adding messages to the window. For testing purposes we did that in the `MainWindow`'s constructor. Let's delete that code now, so there's nothing sending messages.

Now, in the `LoggerUI` singleton class, let's update the `Add` method:

{% highlight c# %}
public void Add(float timestamp, string system, string message)
{
    Debug.Assert(m_application != null);

    // add it to the window via UI thread
    m_application.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke((Action)delegate
    {
        // window can be closed already
        if (m_application.MainWindow == null)
        {
            return;
        }

        (m_application.MainWindow as MainWindow).AddLogEntry(timestamp, system, message);
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Did you notice the `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke` thing we mentioned in the previous post?

Also, create `MainWindow.AddLogEntry` like this:

{% highlight c# %}
public void AddLogEntry(float timestamp, string system, string message)
{
    LogEntries.Add(new LogEntry {
        Timestamp = timestamp,
        System = system,
        Message = message
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our current code won't compile if we do this, because in our `Main` function we're still using the old version of `Add`. Let's fix it:

{% highlight c# %}
LoggerUI.Instance.Add(0.0f, "TEST", "Hello, world!");
{% endhighlight %}

Run it and we have this:

![Connected console and WPF window]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}/assets/images/per-post/log-window-2/console-and-window-connected.png){: .align-center}

Or we could do this as well:

{% highlight c# %}
for(int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
{
    LoggerUI.Instance.Add(0.0f, "TEST", "Hello, world!");
    Thread.Sleep(100);
}
{% endhighlight %}

![Connected console and WPF window with several messages]({{ '/' | absolute_url }}/assets/images/per-post/log-window-2/console-and-window-several-messages.png){: .align-center}

Yay! It works! Looks like we did it, awesome job!

---

In this post we've managed to convert our WPF project into a `Class Library` we can plug into other projects and log whatever we want from that project. We've also defined a Singleton entry point for the library and created the _UI Thread_ in which the _Application_ and _Window_ live.

In the next entry we'll work on adding some extra functionality to the window, like colors, filters and auto-scroll.

See you then!
