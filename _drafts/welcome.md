Hello there and welcome to **codingScars**!

I'm Carlos and this is the first post on this brand new blog. I'm very excited to be writing again and I'm happy that you're reading it!

Back in 2011, my good friend [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsiguero) and I created a blog called _vidasConcurrentes_. It mainly contained programming and computer security related posts. We started using Blogger and migrated it to a self-hosted WordPress when it started to require some extra customizations.  
We had a great time but we started to have less and less time to work on it, so we stopped writing.

Unfortunately, after some years with no new posts we decided it was time to close it for good.

Time has passed now, we graduated from University, got new jobs, been (and keep!) learning new stuff and thought it was time to start writing again!  
We're not sure how frequently we'll be writing new posts, but we'll sure have fun :)

Let's get it started!
